I didn't cover every single facet of the movie in the plot code, but I'd figured I could pull a Ray J and get some things off my chest (if you get this reference, YES QUEEN).
There will also be spoilers in this one too, I guess, so watch out hehe.

1) WHY SPIDERMAN, WHY??????? THIS POOR BOY WAS LITERALLY PLEADING FOR HIS LIFE CAUSE HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO DIE AND HE FELT IT AND I JUST UGH, MY CHEST. MY HEART. MY SOUL (stone).

2) Also can we talk about Drax in this movie? He was SO HILARIOUS, I literally DIED everytime he made a joke and I'm SO SAD he also died. My tiny son. :'^(

3) Although I walked out of this movie pretty angry, it's also kinda obvious that not everyone is permanently dead (although Loki and Gamora are quite questionable cause fuuuUUUCCKKKKKK THEY GOT WREKT), so I'm not too worried about everyone being gone (again, minus Loki and Gamora).

4) TEENAGE GROOT IS LITERALLY THE EMBODIMENT OF MY TEENAGE YEARS

5) HOW TF IS WAKANDA SUPPOSED TO BE OKAY IF THEIR KING IS DEAD? LIKE ZE FEQ????

6) After watching the ending of God of War 4 and realizing Kratos' connection to the Thor lore (hehehehehheeh it rhymed), it makes Thor's axe all the more better, but also FUUUUCCCKKKK HIS SOOOOOOONNNNNNN

7) "Hi I'm Peter Parker." "Hi, I'm Dr. Strange." "Oh, I guess we're going with made up names, I'm Spiderman." I FRIKKING GAGGED AT THIS SCENE

8) aLSO  WHEN THE TITLE OF THE FILM SHOWED AT THE END AND HAD THE SAME PARTICLE EFFECT AS WHEN EVERYONE DIED, THAT WAS TOO SOON. TOO. FUCKING. SOON.

9) Shoutout to the large af text in Times New Roman that showed the different locations. As a graphic designer, I cringed and laughed at the same time.

10) I saw this post on FB about how thinking like the Avengers that they can stop Thanos is like your childhood, and being able to understand Thanos and his mission is adulthood and I was SHOOK.

11) Gamora dying was actually one of the more devastating deaths, just because she actually thought that Thanos didn't love her but then he actually did, and just seeing the context in which she died was just. Damn.
